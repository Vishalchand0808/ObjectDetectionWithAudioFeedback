# ObjectDetectionWithAudioFeedback
I developed a machine learning model utilizing the YOLOv3 algorithm, trained on the MS COCO dataset. This model can detect objects and, through a text-to-speech API, provide voice outputs. This functionality aims to assist visually impaired individuals by offering auditory descriptions of their surroundings.
